We live in a great time where learning to code is now easier than ever, with many free resources available teaching a wide variety of languages. Sites like http://codecademy.com have gained lots of popularity and are a great starting point for beginners to pick up the basics.

However I've been asked the same question over and over and have seen it repeated around the internet. _"I've completed all the exercises in the course for XYZ language, but now what should I do?"_ In my hopinion, the answer to simply start building something. I think that courses and books will only get you so far when it comes to learning to code. Theres no substitute for actually building something.

### What to build?

This can also be daunting to some people, it can be hard to come up with something to build as well as trying to figure out just where to start. Personally, I find building a game is one of the best first projects to do. Having something that you can interact with and directly see the fruits of your labour provides a sense of motivation and a more tangible reward for the work you put in. Simpler games like snake, hangman, tic-tac-toe are some examples of what you could start with. One of the first projects I built was a hangman game that was played in the terminal. It even had a basic AI that would try to guess your word, I remember the sense of amazement and joy when my AI first guessed my word in just a few goes. All the AI did was filter down a list of words from a dictionary file, however it felt like a whole lot more because it was something I could actually see the results of. A simple algorythym felt like magic and motivated me to continue on and see what else I could build.

Of course your choice of language can limit what types of games you can build, eg javascript allows a lot more possibilities as you have the browser to run it in. Even if you don't want to go the route of building a game, thinking up a project where you can really see the results of your labour is the key part. Any utilities that would help automate something your normally do by hand are perfect projects to work on. 

What it comes down to is; writing snippets of code that solve basic problems like Fizzbuzz just doesn't give you that sense of amazement and motivation. They're great for learning syntax and basics of a language but to progress from there, theres no substitute for working on your own project that you actually care about.
