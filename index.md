My name is **Aaron**, and this is my personal website and blog. I am a 26 year old software engineer from New Zealand.

I specialise in the backend side of things, I work with many languages such as Ruby, Python, Javascript and Elixir. I also do a lot of iOS App development, mainly with Objective-C. I'm constantly learning languages and skills to add to my tool belt.

I've built products from the ground up, writing all the core backend infrastructure, front facing API's and even 
the web and iOS apps to go along with them

I love startups and all thing tech, as I've been involved with making my own
websites since I was 13. I've built several companies in that time including
being a **Co-Founder of Algo** which was acquired by Meltwater in 2017.

I am currently the **Head of Engineering** at a new company I co-founded that is in stealth mode.

The languages I work with are:

- Ruby
- Python
- Elixir
- Javascript
- Objective-C 
- SQL
- HTML / CSS / SCSS

I have experience working with these databases / data stores:

- Postgresql
- Elasticsearch 
- Redis
- Realm

And usually use these development frameworks / libraries:

- Ruby on Rails 
- Flask
- Sinatra
- Plug ( Elixir ) 
- Grafana

I'm a big fan of the Google Cloud Platform and have recently been learning to utilize Kubernetes.
