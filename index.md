My name is **Aaron**, and this is my personal website and blog.

I am a 23 year old software developer from New Zealand. I specialise
in **Full Stack Web Development** and **iOS App Development**. However I am
always learning new languages and technologies to try and broaden my skill set.

I love startups and all thing tech, as I've been involved with making my own
websites since I was 13. I've built several companies in that time and am now
currently a Co-Founder of [Algo](http://algo.com). We are doing some awesome
stuff in the news and data spaces.

The languages I work with are:

- Ruby
- Javascript
- Objective-C
- Elixir
- Python (Learning)
- Java (Learning)
- HTML / CSS
- SQL

I also use these libraries / software reguarly:

- Ruby on Rails
- Postgresql
- Redis
- Elasticsearch

Thanks for taking the time to check out my site, please do have a read of my blog
and feel free to comment or get in contact with me.
